## Brief overview
This set of guidelines outlines the implementation planning workflow to be followed for all tasks. It emphasizes checking for existing plans before starting work and using checklists to track progress.

## Planning workflow
- Before starting any task, check if there is an existing plan in the 'ImplementationPlans' directory
- If no plan exists, create a new implementation plan in the 'ImplementationPlans' directory with a descriptive name
- All implementation plans should include a checklist of steps to be completed
- Before moving forward with the implementation itself, always make sure the plan is agreed on by asking the user for feedback
- As each step is completed, mark it off in the checklist to track progress

## Implementation plan structure
- Include a clear overview section that describes the purpose and goals of the plan
- Create a detailed implementation checklist with main sections and sub-tasks
- Provide detailed steps for each major section of the implementation
- Include code snippets, configuration examples, and command examples where appropriate
- Use diagrams (mermaid) when they help clarify the implementation process

## Checklist management
- Use GitHub-style checkboxes: `- [ ]` for incomplete items and `- [x]` for completed items
- Group related checklist items under clear headings
- Update the checklist in real-time as tasks are completed
- Use nested checklists to show task hierarchy and dependencies

## Documentation standards
- Write implementation plans in Markdown format
- Use clear, descriptive file names for implementation plans (e.g., `feature-name-implementation-plan.md`)
- Include all necessary details for someone else to follow the plan
- Document any assumptions, prerequisites, or dependencies
